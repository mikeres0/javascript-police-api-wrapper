# jQuery Police API wrapper  
##### As there are currently no wrappers available that are written in either pure Javascript or jQuery, I thought I'd myself the challenge to do so. Over time I plan to implement all methods documented in the [Police API documentation](https://data.police.uk/docs/ "Police docs"). The project is a work in progress, so all contributions are welcome.
